\subsubsection{Questions for Understanding}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Can you switch branches with modified but uncommitted changes?
	\item Does your working area change when you change branches?
	\item What is a ``fast-forward"?
	\item How do you delete a branch?
	\item In the example given in ``Basic Merging," why is the merge not a
	   ``fast-forward"?
	\item Do merge commits have one parent?
	\item If there is a merge conflict, is a merge commit made?
	\item What command can you use to find out which files have merge conflicts?
	\item How can you tell which branch one side of the merge conflict came from?
	\item Will \verb`git status` indicate if you've finished merging conflicts?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Exercises}
Do exercises in order in the recipes repository.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create and checkout to a new branch, \verb`muffins`.
	   Create a recipe for muffins on the branch, and then merge it into main.
	   What kind of merge was this?
	\item Create and checkout to a new branch, \verb`cake2`.
	   Make a cake recipe that is identical to the one in the branch \verb`cake`,
	   but change the ingredients or baking instructions slightly.
	   Merge \verb`cake` into \verb`main`, and then merge \verb`cake2` into main.
	   You will need to resolve the merge conflict.
	\item Delete all branches except for \verb`main`.
\end{enumerate}
