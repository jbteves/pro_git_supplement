\subsubsection{Questions for Understanding}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Rank the stability of \verb`master` (note: in most new workflows,
	\verb`main`),
	   \verb`develop`, and \verb`topic` in Figure 27.
	\item In Figure 29, why are commits C2 and C4 included in \verb`master`, when they
	   were created in the now-deleted branch \verb`iss91`?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Exercises}
Do exercises in order in the recipes repository.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Similar to Figure 29, do the following:
   \begin{enumerate}
	   \item Create a new branch, \verb`toast`, with a commit holding just the
		  ingredients for a toast recipe.
	   \item Branch off of \verb`toast` to create a branch \verb`toast_v2` that has a recipe
		  for toast that you think is fancy.
		  (Consider "French Toast" or "Cinnamon Toast.")
	   \item Return to the original toast and complete a recipe for plain toast on
		  that branch.
	   \item You want the fancy stuff!
		  Delete the original \verb`toast` branch and merge in \verb`toast_v2`.
		  View the history and make sure you understand why it looks the way it
		  does.
    \end{enumerate}	
\end{enumerate}
