\subsubsection{Questions for Understanding}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is a branch pointing to?
	\item Do commits point to their "children"?
	\item When you create a new branch, do you automatically move to it?
	\item When you check out a branch, what special pointer is moved?
	\item When you make a new commit on a particular branch, are other branches 
	   updated?
	\item What does it mean when two branches' history diverges?

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Exercises}
\begin{enumerate}

   Make some commits on it to create a recipe for cake, and then switch back
   to the `main` branch.
