\subsubsection{Questions for Understanding}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Should you amend a commit if it has been pushed somewhere else?
	\item Does unstaging a file change its contents in the working directory?
	\item In which version of Git was `restore` introduced?
	\item Are changes made with
	   \begin{verbatim}
		   git checkout -- FILE
	   \end{verbatim}
	   or
	   \begin{verbatim}
		   git restore FILE
	   \end{verbatim}
	   recoverable?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Make a commit with a typo, such as "I lik cookies."
	   Then, fix the typo and amend the commit.
	   Try the same with a typo in the commit message itself.
	   What do you notice about the commit hash afterwards?
	\item Stage a commit with some typo.
	   Correct the typo incorrectly,
	   such as "I lik cookies" to "I likee cookies."
	   Then try
	   \begin{enumerate}
		   \item Discarding the second typo and
		   \item Unstaging the first.
	   \end{enumerate}
	   Note how after the unstage operation, the typo remains.
\end{enumerate}
