\subsubsection{Questions for Understanding}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Which specifier for `pretty` gives the author email?
    \item Why are there so many options for showing the git log?
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Exercises}
Use the `recipes` repository for this, even though there's not much
there.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In `recipes`, view the patches of the latest four commits.
    \item View all commits since last week.
    \item View all commits since the first of the month, using the ISO
       datetime format (YYYY-MM-DD).
    \item View all commits, with a format showing only:
    \begin{enumerate}
       \item the short hash
       \item the author name
       \item the commit subject
    \end{enumerate}
    \item View the last three commits, with a format showing only:
    \begin{enumerate}
       \item short hash
       \item commit subject
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
